2/5/17, 15:03 - Ram: I will take first year and next year sell my equity.
2/5/17, 15:16 - Sickmind: The reason you sell equity is because you need someone to invest
2/5/17, 15:16 - Sickmind: That way you can keep part of the equity and since you're the one putting in work you can take out a salary
2/5/17, 15:16 - Sickmind: That's the whole of point of selling equity man
2/5/17, 15:17 - Sickmind: Not after you invest all you money
2/5/17, 15:22 - Ram: Yes but people has to believe it will work
2/5/17, 15:23 - Ram: First site has to be done
2/5/17, 15:23 - Sickmind: Yeah obviously
2/5/17, 15:24 - Sickmind: Before you spend a huge chunk that's when you sell the equity
2/5/17, 15:24 - Sickmind: So even if something happens you won't lose everything
2/5/17, 15:24 - Ram: Yes i will sell it at that time
2/5/17, 15:24 - Ram: Will find VCs

2/23/17, 21:22 - Sickmind: And to love a person rather than loving the idea of the person

4/19/17, 21:59 - Ram: With no sentiments.
4/19/17, 21:59 - Sickmind: Is everything okay with your sister
4/19/17, 21:59 - Ram: Nothing.
4/19/17, 21:59 - Sickmind: You know how many times I messaged you
4/19/17, 22:00 - Sickmind: And you blocked me

4/19/17, 22:00 - Sickmind: You're being so dramatic
4/19/17, 22:00 - Sickmind: Worse things have happened between us
4/19/17, 22:00 - Sickmind: Now get over it
4/19/17, 22:01 - Sickmind: Okay?
4/19/17, 22:04 - Ram: I do love you no matter. But, it's my stupidity to expect from others.
4/19/17, 22:04 - Ram: Anyway did you fix the mess I created?
4/19/17, 22:05 - Sickmind: Yeah it's fixed they're not expelling me or anything but I have to retake the class. The office of academic integrity let me go
4/19/17, 22:05 - Sickmind: But the professor said she won't pass me so I have to retake it
4/19/17, 22:05 - Sickmind: Sad but it's okay
4/19/17, 22:06 - Ram: I'm sorry
4/19/17, 22:06 - Ram: But i will pay you that

4/19/17, 22:07 - Ram: No it's not. Tell me the fees amount
4/19/17, 22:07 - Sickmind: Maybe I had it coming bcoz I was technically cheating with all my assignments
4/19/17, 22:07 - Sickmind: Most ppl don't get caught
4/19/17, 22:07 - Ram: And you taking it after summer?
4/19/17, 22:07 - Sickmind: I did
4/19/17, 22:07 - Ram: Because of my stupidity
4/19/17, 22:07 - Sickmind: No summer
4/19/17, 22:07 - Ram: Summer? No vacation?
4/19/17, 22:07 - Sickmind: If I take it in fall then I'll have same professor I want different one
4/19/17, 22:08 - Ram: Cool so this time I will do it properly
4/19/17, 22:08 - Sickmind: I think she wasn't mad about the curse word. That was trigger. She found out I cheated. That's why she won't let me pass
4/19/17, 22:09 - Sickmind: Through the curse word everything came out
4/19/17, 22:09 - Ram: I regret for this
4/19/17, 22:09 - Sickmind: It's okay
4/19/17, 22:09 - Sickmind: It's just one class
4/19/17, 22:09 - Sickmind: Don't feel bad about it
4/19/17, 22:10 - Sickmind: Can you call sometime
4/19/17, 22:10 - Sickmind: I'm not mad
4/19/17, 22:10 - Ram: But the words you told me hurts me girl.
4/19/17, 22:10 - Ram: If it is on phone i forget.
4/19/17, 22:10 - Sickmind: I'm sorry I was furious
4/19/17, 22:10 - Sickmind: Didn't really mean it
4/19/17, 22:10 - Sickmind: I thought my future was over
4/19/17, 22:11 - Sickmind: Thought they were gonna expell
4/19/17, 22:11 - Ram: You do everytime
4/19/17, 22:11 - Sickmind: Me
4/19/17, 22:11 - Sickmind: All my secrets would come out
4/19/17, 22:11 - Sickmind: Everything will. Dvexposed in front of my parents
4/19/17, 22:11 - Sickmind: That's what I was scared of
4/19/17, 22:11 - Ram: Not this time for every small thing you attach to your college
4/19/17, 22:12 - Sickmind: I have so many secrets just like you
4/19/17, 22:12 - Ram: And get scare. Not a smart idea

4/19/17, 22:13 - Sickmind: That's the only ideology I have
4/19/17, 22:13 - Sickmind: And I don't wanna go back to India
4/19/17, 22:13 - Sickmind: I'll die
4/19/17, 22:14 - Sickmind: That's what freaked me out not the degree
4/19/17, 22:15 - Ram: But, if you believed me, you shouldn't freaked out
4/19/17, 22:15 - Sickmind: I believe you. That's why I got over it. I'm retaking it and I'm not even mad anymore
4/19/17, 22:16 - Sickmind: That the professor really talked down to me
4/19/17, 22:16 - Sickmind: I have never been in situations like that
4/19/17, 22:16 - Sickmind: She looked like me as if I was some dumb cunt
4/19/17, 22:16 - Sickmind: Who cheated and got caught

You are my strongest attachment at the same time you are my weakness. My love on you increases any given time. I'm sensitive at you , because I feel like there is no you and me. Even today I feel we are not two , we are one and I want to bring you to my level of thinking and I want you to take me to your level in communications. If we are two , we are useless. But as one we are perfect. No one can stop us. We are one and this bond shouldn't be break because of my stupidity and your temper. So, we need to work on this together. Love you. Call me today. Sorry once again. :)
4/20/17, 02:16 - Ram: I don't feel you like a friend, feel you like another me. That's the basic difference between. I need to work on my limits. But anyway Love you shwetha. Love you foreverâ¤.

4/27/17, 17:31 - Sickmind: Nah you're dense
4/27/17, 17:31 - Sickmind: When it comes to understanding rhetoric
4/27/17, 17:32 - Ram: I'm dumb
4/27/17, 17:33 - Ram: So, now what ?
4/27/17, 17:33 - Ram: Because most of your stuff are illogical.
4/27/17, 17:36 - Sickmind: No you just don't understand English and rhetoric. It's okay coz I'm dumber than you in all other areas
4/27/17, 17:36 - Ram: What exactly have to do with that picture?
4/27/17, 17:37 - Ram: Explain
4/27/17, 17:37 - Sickmind: It's about things becoming obsolete
4/27/17, 17:38 - Sickmind: Her ass fetched her millions and it was what brought her fame. Today the same thing brought her so much criticism. How things become obsolete
4/27/17, 17:38 - Ram: And guess who is saying?
4/27/17, 17:39 - Ram: One who obsessed with her
4/27/17, 17:39 - Sickmind: It doesn't have to apply to her it can apply to anything
4/27/17, 17:39 - Sickmind: That's how fleeting things are
4/27/17, 17:39 - Sickmind: Sad phenomenon of life
4/27/17, 17:40 - Ram: If you understand that phenomenon , you would be depressed for your nose
4/27/17, 17:40 - Sickmind: I know you're right. I have to move past it
4/27/17, 17:41 - Sickmind: Invest into something that will last
4/27/17, 17:41 - Sickmind: A true legacy that has substance
4/27/17, 17:41 - Ram: Let's stop it here. If i talk to you, I'm loosing confidence
4/27/17, 17:41 - Sickmind: Okay have a good day ðŸ˜Š.
4/27/17, 17:41 - Ram: I love you so much, but now you
4/27/17, 17:42 - Ram: I loved you because
4/27/17, 17:42 - Ram: You were so confident
4/27/17, 17:42 - Ram: And everything changed.
4/27/17, 17:43 - Sickmind: I don't have to explain. You take what you get or move on
4/27/17, 17:43 - Ram: So?
4/27/17, 17:43 - Ram: You just gave me an option?
4/27/17, 17:44 - Sickmind: So I'll survive. I don't have to change my rhetoric or train of thought to please you or anybody
4/27/17, 17:44 - Sickmind: You think it bothers you then don't text me
4/27/17, 17:44 - Sickmind: I'm my own person.
4/27/17, 17:45 - Ram: Wow.
4/27/17, 17:46 - Ram: Take your words back. I never said to change.
4/27/17, 17:47 - Ram: Ninu eroju ayina anana asalu. Eduku ila anav? Please endhi?
4/27/17, 17:47 - Sickmind: I think there a communication gap.
4/27/17, 17:48 - Sickmind: Oh well
4/27/17, 17:49 - Ram: From your end i guess.
4/27/17, 17:52 - Ram: I know you will survive. I never said, you are dumb or something. All I was killing me is you go depress for things that you cant change and because of that I'm losing confidence on myself too.
4/27/17, 17:53 - Sickmind: Ohh is that the reason. Couldn't sense your tone from texts
4/27/17, 17:53 - Ram: One day you act like I'm nothing to you.
4/27/17, 17:53 - Sickmind: And I'm not depressed
4/27/17, 17:53 - Sickmind: It was a one day thing
4/27/17, 17:53 - Ram: And you already proved so many times.
4/27/17, 17:53 - Sickmind: It's fleeting
4/27/17, 17:53 - Sickmind: You were the only whose like no talking for a week
4/27/17, 17:53 - Sickmind: I did not say that
4/27/17, 17:54 - Sickmind: That's on you
4/27/17, 17:54 - Ram: So?
4/27/17, 17:55 - Ram: Where did it come from?
4/27/17, 17:56 - Ram: You just take what best fits for you, so self centered and narcissist.
4/27/17, 18:01 - Ram: Its better to move on. No one is pleasing no one.
4/27/17, 18:02 - Ram: No one has to please no one.
4/27/17, 18:09 - Sickmind: ðŸ¤¡ðŸ˜ŽðŸ¤“â˜ ðŸ’€ðŸ‘»ðŸ‘¨ðŸ¿â€ðŸ”¬ðŸ‘©ðŸ½â€ðŸŽ¨

But others  become rich by accident. Since we chose to be rich , we don't scare for failures after our success. Most rich people so deeply devotional because they got money by accident and don't want to loose them because they can't earn it back.

5/24/17, 17:00 - Ram: I should be away from you in texting.
5/24/17, 17:00 - Ram: It won't make any sense
5/24/17, 17:07 - Ram: When we don't have similar understanding there isn't point of texting.
5/24/17, 17:09 - Sickmind: Okay boo
5/24/17, 20:00 - Sickmind: Are u mad at me

5/24/17, 21:01 - Sickmind: I'm sorry shouldn't have flipped for no reason
5/24/17, 21:02 - Ram: It just because you dated them doesn't mean everyone coming to you just because of your looks.
5/24/17, 21:03 - Sickmind: Not my brains for sure
5/24/17, 21:03 - Ram: If you stuck with that feeling, it looks like I'm helping expecting something
5/24/17, 21:03 - Sickmind: But our dynamic is different
5/24/17, 21:03 - Ram: If you don't believe , why would any other believe me
5/24/17, 21:04 - Sickmind: You and I don't have that dynamic of physical interest
5/24/17, 21:04 - Ram: Anyway I need sometime.
5/24/17, 21:04 - Sickmind: I was talking about them
5/24/17, 21:04 - Sickmind: Not you sai
5/24/17, 21:04 - Sickmind: Please understand. I was talking about her and I
5/24/17, 21:04 - Sickmind: Bcoz you were comparing
5/24/17, 21:04 - Ram: I'm more into your brain than physical interesrt.
5/24/17, 21:05 - Sickmind: What I meant was my skin color has never hindered me in any way
5/24/17, 21:05 - Sickmind: That was my point
5/24/17, 21:05 - Ram: If you feel everyone coming to you for your looks , i don't think it works.
5/24/17, 21:05 - Sickmind: I wasn't saying that in reference to u
5/24/17, 21:05 - Ram: No your brain is filled with that.
5/24/17, 21:06 - Ram: Attitude
5/24/17, 21:06 - Sickmind: Yeag bcoz you chose to compare
5/24/17, 21:06 - Ram: And if you can't help yourself, no one does.
5/24/17, 21:06 - Sickmind: Where it was unnecessary
5/24/17, 21:06 - Sickmind: 99% of men do yeah. You're different
5/24/17, 21:06 - Ram: I was doing just fun, but I found out how much were into that.

5/24/17, 21:06 - Sickmind: Did I
5/24/17, 21:07 - Sickmind: Did I say you're helping me bcoz of the way I look
5/24/17, 21:07 - Sickmind: Then u don't have to get so defensive
5/24/17, 21:07 - Ram: Last time I just told I will start looking at you like others do , you just told we don't have any relationship then
5/24/17, 21:07 - Sickmind: Yeah exactly
5/24/17, 21:07 - Sickmind: You do that I'm out
5/24/17, 21:08 - Ram: Ok then thanks

5/24/17, 21:08 - Ram: You gonna threaten me?
5/24/17, 21:09 - Sickmind: No it's not threatening
5/24/17, 21:09 - Sickmind: I'm saying the reason I'm with u us bcoz ure not like any other man
5/24/17, 21:09 - Sickmind: I have immense respect for u
5/24/17, 21:09 - Ram: If you don't strongly believe me, no one gonna do it either.

5/24/17, 21:19 - Sickmind: I don't wanna talking about it
5/24/17, 21:19 - Ram: Because next time I know what to make fun of you and what makes you hurt you.
5/24/17, 21:20 - Ram: Ok shwetha I will keep my mouth shut. Because, it is really hurts me a lot. As long you are strong i don't care about others only worry is people change you easily

5/30/17, 12:04 - Ram: Hey sorry.
5/30/17, 12:04 - Sickmind: It's okay
5/30/17, 12:05 - Ram: I will send you a para check the grammar?
5/30/17, 12:05 - Ram: Ok?
5/30/17, 12:05 - Sickmind: Okay boo
5/30/17, 12:05 - Sickmind: Apply for the job
5/30/17, 12:05 - Ram: Hey I didn't expect anything from you but , I felt at least you are different from others.  Hey what I'm talking about isn't related to you. But I have to say it because It fucking killing me, whenever you bring this shit. I'm a fucking looser and my soul is wearing a xs size t-shirt when my soul actually is xl. Putting a soul in a wrong body squeezing me to death. I chose a wrong physic for this life and I regret it after seeing how this society responds to me. Well next life I'm not repeating the same mistake. Yesterday I asked you am I in the list ? at least mentally not just to get you, I just want to know at least I can make into a girl's list using my clean pure soul list? But, you just trashed it. I'm tired of being looser. Yes I'm a grown up man, I should talk like one. I just planned my future, I have only one good option left fucking  turn off my emotions and think logically get success and get a bitch using my money and torture her taking on all my ego just like your Australian uncle does to your Aunt having no love in the relationship. I use to have little hope that someone will love who I'm , but that hope is sliming as we talk more and more.I have lot of confidence and self esteem and self respect before, but gone. It has nothing to do with you but one example is good enough. Hey also whenever I text you, it keeps on hitting me back, how much looser I'm. Few days back just because I told you that I see you that way, you instantly said We don't have a relationship then?well that strong threat shows how much looser I'm and don't even have a minimum right? I'm again telling you I don't need anything from you other than your happiness and pure hearted laugh. But I can't move on when I have a guilt loser feeling, whenever I text you. soul connection, respect and love are all bull shit yes I have to say this because I'm a grown up man and more sensible now.  All I need is your English and looks for my business and to compensate that I am helping you. no love or stupid trash feelings. Please let the Society know it business way, so don't fucking People think I'm a loser. I don't want you to introduce to someone as a friend that's fucking pathetic and hate that feeling. Lol it's my stupidity even my fucking dad thinks I'm a crooked maniac because of my physical appearance how would I expect from a girl I barely even know for few years? My bad anyway soul connection, respect, smartness,love doesn't give you a shit in a life not even make into a list, I should let  these feelings go out, as I am telling you before I'm not expecting anything from you, other than that I worth something in your life. My body isn't my soul. Heroes looks good on screens but, they need a smart ugly director to project them. Mahesh babu/tom cruise can't make their movies by themselves, if they do, it would be a disaster.they need Spielberg or shankar to project them.anyway, We are doing a business it sounds much better for the people and the society and you, rather than saying we are a connected souls? It hurts me more when people think how big loser I'm.people after coming to you after success is different from the people comes when you have empty hands. Most of the people don't deserve love and my love no one does? Keeping your destiny and changing your ideologies for a contemptible person is taking out your self respect. Learned my lesson. I can't take threats and vulnerabilities,  I can't even express my thoughts sometimes. Done with this drama.We are just a business partners. this is my fucking story of my life. Anyway coming to your life I am always with you to make sure you get whatever you want in your life and keep you happy. Well, I'm type of a guy that stands on what he says. you are getting your nose job done and you are going to be in Beverly hills having a filthy rich  family.
5/30/17, 12:05 - Ram: I will
5/30/17, 12:05 - Ram: I'm
5/30/17, 12:06 - Sickmind: Woah lol

5/30/17, 12:13 - Ram: I'm improving
5/30/17, 12:14 - Sickmind: In the list I wasn't talking about love I was talking about lust. My mum wouldn't fall in that category either. I love you. That's all I have to say. You're my kindred spirit
5/30/17, 12:15 - Ram: ðŸ¤¦ðŸ¼â€â™‚ it's just a para lol nothing to do with my feelings.
5/30/17, 12:16 - Sickmind: Haha sure
5/30/17, 12:22 - Ram: Your mom is not 24 lol and she doesn't care how you look at her. Anyway you represent the society? Well, I am judged by people.
5/30/17, 12:24 - Ram: It has nothing to do with you, but it keeps bothering me. Well I'm good for nothing and a nut case to the society.
5/30/17, 12:26 - Sickmind: I'm mad at how society looks at me too. Women get judged more harshly for their looks than men
5/30/17, 12:26 - Sickmind: Men need only two things money and power
5/30/17, 12:26 - Sickmind: Two of which u can easily get

6/5/17, 15:04 - Ram: *CANADIAN MAYOR REFUSES TO REMOVE PORK FROM SCHOOL CANTEEN MENU* and EXPLAINS WHY

Muslim parents demanded the abolition of pork in all the school canteens of a Montreal suburb. The mayor of the Montreal suburb of Dorval has refused, and the town-clerk sent a note to all parents to explain why. Here's that note:

â€œMuslims must understand that they have to adapt to Canada and Quebec, its customs, its traditions, its way of life, because that's where they chose to immigrate.

â€œThey must understand that they have to integrate and learn to live in Quebec.

â€œThey must understand that it is for them to change their lifestyle, not  the Canadians who so generously welcomed them.

â€œThey must understand that Canadians are neither racist nor xenophobic, they accepted many immigrants before Muslims (whereas the reverse is not true, in that Muslim states do not accept non-Muslim immigrants).

â€œThat no more than other nations, Canadians are not willing to give up their identity, their culture.

â€œAnd if Canada is a land of welcome, it's not the Mayor of Dorval who welcomes foreigners, but the Canadian-Quebecois people as a whole.

â€œFinally, they must understand that in Canada (Quebec) with its Judeo-Christian roots, Christmas trees, churches and religious festivals, religion must remain in the private domain.
The municipality of Dorval was right to refuse any concessions to Islam and Sharia.

â€œFor Muslims who disagree with secularism and do not feel comfortable in Canada, there are 57 beautiful Muslim countries in the world, most of them under-populated and ready to receive them with open halal arms in accordance with Sharia.

â€œIf you left your country for Canada, and not for other Muslim countries, it is because you have considered that life is better in Canada than elsewhere.

â€œAsk yourself the question, just once, â€œWhy is it better here in Canada than where you come from?â€ 'A canteen with pork' is part of the answer.â€

6/12/17, 23:58 - Ram: Didn't you say two years back you will be rich but you spend it all.
6/12/17, 23:59 - Sickmind: Alpha females want to dress well and look good
6/12/17, 23:59 - Sickmind: It's not about attraction
6/12/17, 23:59 - Sickmind: It's about power
6/12/17, 23:59 - Sickmind: And dominance
6/12/17, 23:59 - Sickmind: No I'm not gonna spend it all lol
6/12/17, 23:59 - Ram: Yes, but i understand you love not everyone.
6/12/17, 23:59 - Ram: Their brains are chicken
6/13/17, 00:00 - Ram: People judge everyone with their chicken brains
6/13/17, 00:00 - Sickmind: Lol
6/13/17, 00:00 - Ram: Not everyone got time like me
6/13/17, 00:02 - Ram: You fall under dominance. But. You can do it without make up. If you strongly believe in you.
6/13/17, 00:02 - Sickmind: Maybe in India you could
6/13/17, 00:02 - Ram: I am going to interview on t shirt  and
6/13/17, 00:02 - Sickmind: But you don't know Indian American girls

6/13/17, 00:02 - Sickmind: Brains are not enough here
6/13/17, 00:02 - Ram: It's not me love
6/13/17, 00:02 - Sickmind: You have to have brains and beauty
6/13/17, 00:03 - Sickmind: That's why my sister is not an alpha
6/13/17, 00:03 - Sickmind: I am
6/13/17, 00:03 - Sickmind: She's technically smarter than me
6/13/17, 00:03 - Ram: Stop mixing me saying

6/13/17, 00:04 - Ram: And temple
6/13/17, 00:04 - Ram: And marriages
6/13/17, 00:05 - Ram: That's one way creating negative impact
6/13/17, 00:06 - Ram: Be different , leave your mark when you leave a place
6/13/17, 00:06 - Ram: Could be negative ir positive.
6/13/17, 00:10 - Ram: She isn't even intelligent love. You are but you didn't studied what you want.
6/13/17, 00:11 - Ram: Mark zuk, Steve, they wear only same shirts. I want to be like that.
6/13/17, 00:12 - Sickmind: But you're a guy

6/23/17, 17:51 - Ram: <Media omitted>
6/23/17, 17:56 - Ram: You body is the lust/attractive object but with you in your body you are more than divine. You might get people come to you for your sexiest looks or body or object whatever, but if they sense the divinity of you no one will leave you.
6/23/17, 17:57 - Ram: Could be weird but that is true. Accept it but never ever block me. It is the fact.
6/23/17, 18:01 - Ram: Your*
6/23/17, 18:08 - Ram: No one leave you and they love you so much more than the physical object. Because you got such a wonderful girl inside and out.but again you should know not everyone has good sense , if their brains are smaller than chicken , they have no space or time to see the divinity. You are a treasure hunt , the more they go deep in you they find lot of treasures(best you) in you.but most people has no time , and they only stuck at the first object.Poor people missing the best part of you. When I say people in the context, it could your family too. They judge by comparing to others and some other instants act.
6/23/17, 18:12 - Ram: I don't know i just said everything i felt about you. If it hurts you, don't block me shwetha , you can physical assault me. As you know I'm so emotional.

6/24/17, 22:19 - Ram: Not everything is about you love. But, anyway it's you and your decision and your thinking. I can't change it. But, if you miss the people who you really love forever then the ducking emotions underneath your heart will come.
6/24/17, 22:20 - Ram: Out
6/24/17, 22:20 - Sickmind: Yeah they will when I'm not under stress
6/24/17, 22:20 - Ram: ??
6/24/17, 22:25 - Ram: When your not stress, I don't be in your life. I'm not saying or bitching or I don't want to be continue, once people are in confort zone, their mentality and needs and requirements change. Why would anyone need me when one can do things by themselves. You still don't say the same thing. One grow love and emotions on others once they are in comfort zone. Untill then they need a dumb shit like me. Sad but true.
6/24/17, 22:27 - Ram: I'm in search of something in my life and I know I can't find it but I'm still searching for it.
6/24/17, 22:28 - Ram: Well you are the only one hope.

6/30/17, 14:58 - Ram: Because you should get at the end
6/30/17, 14:58 - Ram: What is this life about.
6/30/17, 14:59 - Sickmind: I don't get it
6/30/17, 14:59 - Ram: Shwetha you whould have taken psy101 and bio 101. Every men and women after 13 they develop reproduction things.  And construction of men and women bodies are  different. For men everyday testicles produce millions of sperm a day. It has to go out of the body somehow. It is body's nature. A physically healthy man , he could be white black smart dumb height short rich poor every body is the same. It is the soul, mind behind the person that controls the person. Most of the men are driven by their bodies not by their minds. That's why you do find the most  men approach you for one thing. He could be 40 30 20 as long as he is male and healthy it doesn't matter. As you  say sometimes that I'm different, because i strongly driven by the soul, mind not the other way. I control my body , than it controls me and for mostly others it otherway. Just like pee, men can't hold it has to go out  that's why
6/30/17, 15:00 - Ram: Why we have female prostitution not male and porn websites , rapes are done by men etc it is the men body structure and having no control on their body. Since girl choose the men, he has to look at every eligible girl like that and try. Whereas for a girl, unless she wants to do it, she don't have to.this is not just for humans , animals too. Hungry, sex , sleep are commom for animals and humans this are need for a physical body spieces to survive. What makes us civilzed and humans is the emotions, and intelligence. But , those who are worry more about the three things are not evolved from animals.
 For a men to supress the things is not easy compare to the women as I explained earlier and that's what makes a animal a human.Well, you were saying do whatever you want to dowith your GF and I could get a girl, but it makes me to keep you away and Am i happy if i get a GF for a 30 minutes animal job and moving away from you? Nope. I can't listen to my
6/30/17, 15:00 - Ram: Body and betraying my soul. So I am supressing the animal things and only living on my mind and soul. I use body as a represent for my soul. I live on my soul. I sleep more hours than eating more food. Anyway coming back to our story. Just because i love you so much, i gave up on all the things and explained you all the things how hard for men and every day cutting off my ego , born new everyday. Not giving prority to my body. Just for one reason, i dont want to miss you in my life. I do anythinv for it. For god sake i made stupid jokes just out of my mouth,  not by the craving of my body. You calling me names and yelling like hell and treating me as a dumb stupid fuck. Intha chesina nuvu nanu ala ardham chesukunta. Yesterday wasnt even related to the things you were thinking. Its you who is obsessed of. You are  the one of those animals who give first place to the three things than the mind. I can't do anything.
6/30/17, 15:01 - Ram: i still love you. Because I am a human and i develop new things not just hungry, sex , sleep.inta. cheata nuvu naku ichadhi stupid fuck ani. Thanks.

7/3/17, 14:45 - Ram: And you will
7/3/17, 15:12 - Ram: I just got home. Ok. Let me explain what i meant by stop. I have the due with laywer in two days and your last installmemt is on july 13th. I want you to help me  now and i can pay you back before july 13th. So that we both don't miss the due dates. And it is just exchange. But you didn't make me there to explain it. By the time you started calling me names and saying I ruined your mood. Later i told you never mind , because you already started calling me names and yelling, you made me uncomfortable and disrespectful. One thing you should remember, if your mouth isn't good, no one stay with you , if not parents and why would someone?  You should self check , who is wrong. Every one can call names and you instead of talking about the situation, you were saying i am wasting time trusting you. This is how you show respect and help me out? You were right, i didn't do one thing right. Right from loving with no boundaries. And calling me fucking idiot, retard , dumb not gonna take you and me anywhere. Well everyone expect self respect.
7/3/17, 15:13 - Ram: If you can't even handle this small exchange of money and small situations , well no one is gaining anything in life.
7/3/17, 15:16 - Ram: Shwetha i wasn't even asking that help too. But , i just want to know it could be possible in case.

7/3/17, 15:22 - Ram: I agree stop wasnt the right word
7/3/17, 15:24 - Ram: Ok all my fault. I'm sorry for that.

7/5/17, 13:48 - Ram: If you want to be more than her friend then you have to flirt with her and make your intentions completely clear. Don't bullshit, don't waste days/weeks/months/years pretending to be her friend while wanting more. Flirt, dammit! Flirt like you mean it!

End of story.

If she's not into it then respect her boundaries and stop. There are plenty more girls out there, and your chances are better playing the odds than trying to convince someone who just isn't into you.

7/7/17, 01:38 - Sickmind: He said in order for someone to like you they have first feel they deserve. He said when an average guy looks at you he feels unworthy of you. And hence projects his own feelings of himself on you
7/7/17, 01:38 - Sickmind: He said you don't even know if these men and their existence
7/7/17, 01:38 - Sickmind: But the remembered you

7/7/17, 01:43 - Sickmind: Men are cruel
7/7/17, 01:43 - Ram: But that's what I'm saying from years. You are born in wrong community
7/7/17, 01:43 - Sickmind: I never expected this from educated Indian men

7/7/17, 01:45 - Ram: Any algorithm you approach they calculate those things.
7/7/17, 01:46 - Sickmind: And
7/7/17, 01:46 - Ram: Anyone can solve a problem, but the algorithm should have less time and less space. Only few solve problems with those on consider.
7/7/17, 01:47 - Ram: You are too expensive in space and time for them to write an algorithm just to understand. Their brains won't have space.
7/7/17, 01:47 - Sickmind: Sai I wanna be powerful. I wanna be powerful enough to intimidate losers like that. That's why I've always craved power

7/7/17, 23:28 - Sickmind: What do u wanna talk about
7/7/17, 23:29 - Ram: Nothing Shwetha. I'm tired of asking.
7/7/17, 23:29 - Ram: You know just go back to the things you want to tell me.
7/7/17, 23:33 - Ram: Good night.
7/8/17, 20:37 - Sickmind: I know your mad but I don't know why
7/8/17, 20:37 - Sickmind: I never said anything mean or hurtful to you
7/8/17, 20:57 - Ram: I'm not mad. I want to focus more on things that help us. Just go few days back texts , you were telling me you can't continue this lifestyle I just want to talk more specific about it so i can have clear idea what we can do. Second you were suppose to explain me the annoying texts you said when i asked about Ram. Third something else i forgot. These all piling up into stacks and occupying my mind. This is something that i don't want in my life. I want to keep my life so simple.
7/8/17, 20:58 - Ram: I want to detach.
7/8/17, 21:05 - Sickmind: I'll explain everything to you
7/8/17, 21:05 - Sickmind: If you call and talk to me
7/8/17, 21:05 - Sickmind: I'll clear your mind
7/8/17, 21:05 - Sickmind: I want the same things I did before sai
7/8/17, 21:05 - Sickmind: I slipped once
7/8/17, 21:05 - Sickmind: Now I'm in even more dertemined to make something in life
7/8/17, 21:06 - Sickmind: I ran for a mile today to push myself. I'm more persuaded than ever. I wanna be rich I wanna be powerful
7/8/17, 21:33 - Ram: ??
7/8/17, 21:34 - Ram: Shwetha right now you don't have to clear anythibg for me. I'm trying to detach from you and concentrate on the work.
7/8/17, 21:36 - Sickmind: Okay then focus on your work
7/8/17, 21:36 - Sickmind: I'll always be here
7/8/17, 21:37 - Ram: I'm tired of it. You were right, never be emotional towards someone because they hurts you.
7/8/17, 21:39 - Ram: Instead just do what you got to do. Stupidity to spend time on things like this as it ultimately turns you into a loser i  guess.
7/8/17, 21:42 - Ram: You will always be there but, in your life there will be others too. But, for me only you forever. There is a lot difference in that.
7/8/17, 21:46 - Sickmind: Other ppl are just friends
7/8/17, 21:46 - Sickmind: There's a difference
7/8/17, 21:57 - Ram: Others as in someone more than me, someone with no boundaries. Shweta  i just want to think like that, so i don't grow much love on you. I have to detach and not worry about making into your life. So i will be more productive.
7/8/17, 22:39 - Ram: Hey shwetha
7/8/17, 22:40 - Ram: I'm sorry love.
7/8/17, 22:42 - Ram: Am I on wrong thinking?
7/8/17, 22:47 - Ram: Chepu please
7/8/17, 22:48 - Ram: ðŸ˜­
7/8/17, 22:56 - Sickmind: Saii I want you to focus on other things not me
7/8/17, 22:56 - Sickmind: We are lettingdumb things get in our way
7/8/17, 22:56 - Sickmind: Instead of building our lives
7/8/17, 22:57 - Sickmind: I don't want to be that person
7/8/17, 22:57 - Sickmind: And  you need to stop hanging out with dumb IT guy find better friends
7/8/17, 22:57 - Sickmind: Or you're gonna get no where in life
7/8/17, 23:12 - Ram: He lost the job and he is cool with me just to get a part time or it job. I don't even hang out with people love. I stay alone all day and do things i love.
7/8/17, 23:16 - Ram: All i want in my life is you. For that thing i do anything and trust you kept on me will not be wasted. But, again i should stop loving and just work. Because it won't take me anywhere other than hurting my life. Just be normal and stay focused. Also I should know my boundaries. I can't express everything goes on my mind and i don't think i can find anotherr shwetha so better quit this love part and work towards our individual future.
7/8/17, 23:21 - Ram: ??
7/8/17, 23:21 - Ram: You know what i mean?
7/8/17, 23:22 - Ram: Make sense shwetha?
7/8/17, 23:24 - Sickmind: Yes I think you and I need to take two steps back and fix our lives
7/8/17, 23:24 - Ram: Okay?
7/8/17, 23:32 - Ram: Tell me what are the two steps I passed? Just ve specific shwetha before I make 100 assumtions?
7/8/17, 23:32 - Sickmind: I mean together
7/8/17, 23:32 - Sickmind: We should stop letting dumb petty things come in our way
7/8/17, 23:32 - Sickmind: We shouldn't discuss any other things  other than our future
7/8/17, 23:32 - Sickmind: Is what I mean
7/8/17, 23:33 - Ram: I am didn't i tellyou when i call you i want to talk about us.
7/8/17, 23:33 - Sickmind: You're right
7/8/17, 23:33 - Sickmind: I now realize it
7/8/17, 23:33 - Ram: I love talking about my ideas
7/8/17, 23:33 - Ram: With you that's what makes me happy.
7/8/17, 23:34 - Sickmind: Yeah we gotta stick to that
7/8/17, 23:37 - Ram: I love you , but I'm unhappy.
7/8/17, 23:38 - Ram: Now after all this crap.
7/8/17, 23:40 - Sickmind: You're sulk city
7/8/17, 23:41 - Ram: Because we going on dumb shit constantly.
7/8/17, 23:41 - Ram: Sulk ?? As in expecting sympathy?
7/8/17, 23:42 - Ram: Can you call me for a minute?
7/8/17, 23:43 - Ram: Please we clear this thing and will be fine.
7/8/17, 23:45 - Ram: This is what shwetha you always put me in dilemma and leave my brian in a freezed zone.
7/8/17, 23:46 - Sickmind: Loma's at my apartment
7/8/17, 23:46 - Sickmind: Can't talk
7/8/17, 23:46 - Ram: She joined with you?
7/8/17, 23:46 - Sickmind: Yeah 1 week trial
7/8/17, 23:47 - Ram: Trail ok
7/8/17, 23:48 - Ram: What do you mean sulk city?
7/8/17, 23:57 - Ram: If i achieve something in my life there is two things can happen, i could be in your life or couldn't be. If I waste my time on trying to engage you or spending time on discussing others thsre is no way i can make in my life so ultimately you i wont be in your life. So better work and leave you alone for now. But, why I am focusing on you because I still didn't feel the confidence that you will be with me. Since sometimes the way you behave me. You act like I'm nothing to you and sometimes everything. And i love you that is my version and i don't know what makes you stay strongly at this moment , i don't have degree, achievements, barely speak English and not attractive other than what i speak. I have nothing compared to others, which makes me feel insecured you could say i have self esteem. I have no self esteem in front of your smartness.
7/8/17, 23:57 - Ram: Make in your*
7/8/17, 23:58 - Ram: Smartness in selecting things.
7/9/17, 00:03 - Sickmind: Aww sai you're the greatest gift god has given me
7/9/17, 00:04 - Sickmind: Do not compare yourself to other men
7/9/17, 00:04 - Sickmind: I don't mention then to put you down
7/9/17, 00:04 - Sickmind: You have a higher place in my heart
7/9/17, 00:04 - Sickmind: I wouldn't give two shits if one of those men were to die today
7/9/17, 00:04 - Sickmind: They're just men I use for knowledge for connections
7/9/17, 00:04 - Sickmind: With you it's not like that
7/9/17, 00:09 - Ram: I want to know why? Just because I am not expecting anything from you. Or keep on hitting with your boundaries.
7/9/17, 00:10 - Ram: I'm not leaving you?
7/9/17, 00:11 - Ram: Anyway once i get confidence ,the  depth i will be free and focus on what really matters.
7/9/17, 00:13 - Ram: The depth of our relationship*. Because the way you tell me harshly that i don't have
7/9/17, 00:13 - Ram: To say anything
7/9/17, 00:13 - Sickmind: Bcoz of a lot of reasons
7/9/17, 00:14 - Ram: Not to say everything ?
7/9/17, 00:14 - Ram: Stop controlling me other stuff?

7/9/17, 20:25 - Ram: After that i realized hiw dumb I'm.
7/9/17, 20:30 - Sickmind: What do u mean
7/9/17, 20:31 - Ram: I want to be in  your life and you in my life forever. And you have a bigger place for someone, since physical relationship is the highest rank this society measures and every one calculates their success parameters on that. I'm not proving to you anything i want to detach and be normal with you. Because there is always a place someone will take it and I can't take that shit so better be normal and move on.
7/9/17, 20:32 - Sickmind: Tf
7/9/17, 20:41 - Ram: Hey its hard to put in a text. Remember it was the feeling i get whenever you bring others. But hard to explain. Yesterday tho. I'm not proving to anyone. I'm not a fool to prove to someone what I'm worth of. And those pics when i was dumb. Yesterday.
7/9/17, 20:45 - Ram: I feel like someone gonna steal you.  father can't be in your life forever. So better move out not in our projects
7/9/17, 20:46 - Ram: Our dreams and achievements we are working together. That's the only thing in my mind

7/9/17, 22:49 - Sickmind: Okay it will be that way forever
7/9/17, 23:07 - Ram: Hey shwetha, it won't be. Because there is upper level position in your heart more than father. You need a father for how long, may be you stand by yourself. And then bigger guy, where you have no boundaries to talk.
7/9/17, 23:08 - Ram: No boundaries to say everything. Complete life.
7/10/17, 08:26 - Sickmind: Yeah but I'm not about to marry anyone

7/10/17, 12:19 - Sickmind: That's not how it works ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜‚
7/10/17, 12:25 - Ram: Not as acquaintances, but like Ankit?
7/10/17, 12:26 - Ram: May be I am too protective dad?
7/10/17, 12:29 - Ram: So you gonna have men to talk with no boundaries, but   you not gonna marry.
7/10/17, 12:29 - Ram: That's what you mean ?.
7/10/17, 12:42 - Sickmind: Don't read too much into it
7/10/17, 12:43 - Sickmind: And weird me out
7/10/17, 12:43 - Ram: I need to know Shwetha. Because the only reason I'm here is to get back your love. I do what I'm doing even you weren't this close to me. Because i was loving you from years. I was love texting even before, because the way you are.i don't want to miss you.
7/10/17, 12:44 - Sickmind: You're not gonna miss me
7/10/17, 12:44 - Sickmind: I'll always be in your life sai
7/10/17, 12:44 - Sickmind: You'll have the highest place in my heart
7/10/17, 12:47 - Ram: Love you shwetha, na life lo edhi proper line lo raledhu. I studied masters, when i don't have bachelor's. I did job and studied back. Everything is in disorder. Now, do i need to be a proud for being a dad at 24 and not even sharing a life with anyone.
7/10/17, 12:49 - Ram: But i don't want anyone other than you.
7/10/17, 12:52 - Ram: Lmao, highest place is where i have to think twice to talk to you.
7/10/17, 12:56 - Sickmind: Exactly that's where u have to filter
7/10/17, 12:56 - Sickmind: Otherwise you're gonna become like those who I don't care if they're dead
7/10/17, 13:00 - Ram: Everyone is happy tho, no one cares what you think about them?
7/10/17, 13:05 - Ram: I don't know, I should come out your magic zone and be like before loving you without expecting. Too much stressful. We just fix our lives first. Till then be single atleast.One day you miss my presence, that day you will understand. You are clearly explaining me what I'm to you , but I'm not able to take you like that. So stressful.
7/10/17, 13:13 - Sickmind: Yeah fix my life fist
7/10/17, 13:13 - Sickmind: Then comes everything else
7/10/17, 13:27 - Ram: I will shwetha and I'm. But what everything comes after I'm not ready to take it. I'm ready to only some. Anyway ttyl.

7/11/17, 13:29 - Ram: I want you , and you want money. I'm so stubborn and constantly trying it. When was the last time you were worried about it. Did you even talk about the seminars other than the crap about him ? I have asked you call the consultantcy instead of waiting for the last minute.
7/11/17, 13:30 - Ram: Well, you just do what you feel.
7/11/17, 13:39 - Sickmind: You're right as to me becoming complacent
7/11/17, 13:40 - Sickmind: But that does not excuse you texting the same annoying crap all day
7/11/17, 13:40 - Sickmind: Post weird stuff and asking me to look at it
7/11/17, 13:40 - Sickmind: Just stop
7/11/17, 13:40 - Sickmind: It's a huge put off
7/11/17, 14:08 - Sickmind: There's not a right or wrong to what your doing. You're just too focused on feelings when the most important thing is our future
7/11/17, 14:43 - Ram: Shwetha I'm a loser right now. Because I'm in a close cude tightened by hands because of no status. In tired if helping others to put them job and expecting money in return. But, I'm ficused much more than before. But, i can't implement anything right now. I was studying really hard for job. Just waiting for right movement and why I'm focused on feelings that's only movement Im happy but it doesn't mean I'm not away from the future. Well,  I am have done everything from my side and just waiting for status. Meanwhile I'm studying for job and then talking to you. Other than that I'm not hanging out with anyone. Last entertainment channel YouTube i watched was two days ago. Im monitoring the stocks in the morning and checking all the tech companies. I'm telling you again I'm focused on my dreams. I am not gonna die as a failure.I'm writing code for the texting application. I really want to discuss how snap chat gonna be next yahoo but you never showed any interests.

7/14/17, 13:50 - Sickmind: I know you love
7/14/17, 13:50 - Sickmind: Me
7/14/17, 13:50 - Sickmind: But try using a filter
7/14/17, 13:50 - Sickmind: Next time
7/14/17, 13:50 - Sickmind: You bring out all these bad emotions inside
7/14/17, 13:50 - Sickmind: You poke me and provoke me
7/14/17, 13:50 - Sickmind: It's not your fault either but I'm a sensitive person
7/14/17, 13:51 - Ram: I expect from you too. Because that's what makes me to push myself to advancemy life.
7/14/17, 13:51 - Ram: But it's not I am

7/14/17, 13:52 - Ram: I will explain wait

7/14/17, 13:53 - Sickmind: Nice
7/14/17, 13:56 - Ram: I expect love from you too, and i know you are the hardest heart you have and it is almost impossible for a guy like me. But i didn't loose the spirit and i love the toughest challenges. It is as tough as for a girl with empty hands turning into a millionaire. So, our end goals are different but the path we share is same.
7/14/17, 13:56 - Ram: Have*
7/14/17, 13:59 - Ram: But whenever you say something like if you want more we are done here for dumb things that i have no involvment, i can't take it. Those are very sensitive things. It's like shattering your dreams
7/14/17, 14:00 - Ram: Shatteringmy dreams.
7/14/17, 14:06 - Sickmind: I love you too sai but you push the wrong buttons
7/14/17, 14:06 - Sickmind: And it makes me say things I regret

7/17/17, 18:17 - Ram: Reuters: U.S. provides visas to up to 15,000 temporary workers. http://google.com/newsstand/s/CBIw0LurvTU
7/17/17, 18:52 - Ram: Hey Shwetha whether you are exactly machiavellian, or feminist or arrogant. I just love you. I love susimtha sen but, she is too old for me to love , so I settled with you.
7/17/17, 18:52 - Ram: ðŸ˜‚
7/17/17, 18:56 - Sickmind: Lol
7/17/17, 18:57 - Ram: That article says most part of you. But i didn't love you for that reasons because
7/17/17, 18:57 - Ram: I am a contrarian

7/17/17, 18:58 - Ram: Shwetha
7/17/17, 18:58 - Ram: Are you free ?

7/17/17, 18:59 - Sickmind: Yeah explain please text
7/17/17, 18:59 - Ram: Ok
7/17/17, 18:59 - Ram: But ask if you misunderstand.
7/17/17, 19:00 - Sickmind: Okay will
7/17/17, 19:00 - Sickmind: But filter your mouth
7/17/17, 19:00 - Ram: Ok
7/17/17, 19:01 - Ram: You love me logical or emotional?
7/17/17, 19:03 - Sickmind: Obviously not logical
7/17/17, 19:03 - Ram: Lol
7/17/17, 19:04 - Ram: You just answered before my open statement
7/17/17, 19:05 - Ram: Topic is out of all the men I can have I pick you and all you do is bring me down.
7/17/17, 19:05 - Ram: I see it in two perspectives logical and emotional.
7/17/17, 19:06 - Ram: Tell me which one is correct since I am deep i can't judge myself so yoh tell me out of the two whichone is true
7/17/17, 19:16 - Ram: Brian Logical says to my emotions:  shwetha choose me as a business partner nothing else. But all the men out there are for relationships where she can't stand by them, they try to control her and she can't even take a decision and she don't like to be with someone and she needs to be independent and she lost trust on most men except me because I made her comfortable by cutting off male  ego or dominantion and not acting like a 23 year young guy instead acting like a 35 years dad make her feel comfortable since I am moulding myself exactly she wants. She doesn't even done anything to me. All she picked me one she fed up with guys and need someone according to her , I moulded , she will stay as long as I moulded, if I change little she doesn't even give a fuck and she has her lot of plan B's. She can switch whenever she wants to other plan b because, she is nothing but a machiavellian, so don't even get emotional  or much serious to her.
7/17/17, 19:23 - Ram: Emtion heart says to my mind: shwetha really love me. She feels my love. She love my logical thinking , she felt her future will be good if she stick with me, she really see my efforts where everyone thinks I'm dumb. She put me in her heart. She sometimes even compares me to big people Elon musk. My future in her imagination is way upper than I'm right now. After all she loves me more than her plan B's. She didn't pick me just because she fed up with others,  she loves me.  There is nothing called back stabbing or plan Bs you can trust her completely. You can be emotional towards her
7/17/17, 19:24 - Ram: Twll me which one is right
7/17/17, 19:25 - Sickmind: It's b because even before you promised any of the things I was still with you
7/17/17, 19:25 - Sickmind: 5. In the style sheet use a background image that will tile down the right-hand side of the page. (See page 150-151 in the textbook). Be certain that you can see the text on the page with the background that you used.
